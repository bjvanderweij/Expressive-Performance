# Expressive performance

This repository contains an implementation of a performance rendering system proposed [here](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~bredeweg/pdf/BSc/20102011/VanDerWeij.pdf).

Also included are a bunch of tools for manipulating midi and musicxml files and loading and parsing files form the CrestMusePEDB expressive performance database.

This repository was used for the project that concluded my Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence at the university of Amsterdam

### Future work

* Plug in a more reliable melody extractor
* Plug in a more sensible (hierarchical) phrase segmentation system
